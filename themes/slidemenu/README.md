slidemenu theme for Nikola
==========================

A minimalistic, responsive-ish theme for Nikola, based on the `base-jinja` theme, with a slide-out menu.

Customization
-------------

You can customize the theme by creating a `custom.css` file (`files/assets/css/custom.css`). Copy-paste the `/* Color preferences */` section from the provided `slidemenu.css` file and choose your own color scheme. Make sure to change `THEME_COLOR` in `conf.py` to fit.

The theme defaults to the system font stack (taken from Bootstrap 4), but you can use your own fonts by editing CSS.

*This theme was originally created in January 2016 for a private project and is now being made available to the public, with some modifications.*
